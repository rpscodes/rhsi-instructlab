= Architecture  

This architecture outlines a solution for securely deploying a local AI chatbot using **InstructLab** and **Skupper**, while ensuring data privacy and seamless communication between isolated environments. The model is hosted in a private environment, and the service is exposed through a public OpenShift deployment, allowing external access while safeguarding the underlying data and models.

The core elements include:
- **InstructLab** for hosting, training, and serving the AI model in a secure environment.
- **Red Hat Service Interconnect (RHSI)** combined with **Skupper** to create a **Virtual Application Network (VAN)** between private and public sites, enabling secure communication.
- **OpenShift** for exposing the chatbot to external users while maintaining scalability and secure connectivity to the model.

== Common Challenges  

1. **Secure Model Hosting**: Protecting sensitive AI models while allowing controlled external access.  
2. **Hybrid Connectivity**: Facilitating communication between private and public environments without compromising security.  
3. **Data Privacy**: Ensuring that private data remains in a protected environment while providing real-time AI responses to external users.

* **Red Hat supported products**
  ** https://www.redhat.com/en/technologies/cloud-computing/openshift[Red Hat OpenShift]  
     Red Hat OpenShift is a Kubernetes-based container platform that allows developers to build, deploy, and manage containerized applications. It provides a robust platform for scaling and automating applications across hybrid cloud environments, ensuring reliability and security.
     
  ** https://www.redhat.com/en/technologies/cloud-computing/service-interconnect[Red Hat Service Interconnect (RHSI)]  
     Red Hat Service Interconnect (RHSI) enables secure communication between services across different environments. Using a Virtual Application Network (VAN), it ensures that services in private, public, and hybrid cloud environments can seamlessly interact without exposing sensitive data directly.

  ** https://instructlab.ai/[InstructLab]  
     InstructLab is an AI model platform that simplifies the process of training, serving, and managing large language models. It is designed to be flexible and secure, making it ideal for environments where models need to remain private but still serve external requests through controlled access paths.

[#in_depth]  
== An in-depth look at the solution's architecture  

This architecture is based on a hybrid setup where the AI model is trained and served via **InstructLab** in a private environment (Site A) and can only be accessed by external users through a public **OpenShift** site (Site B), using **Skupper** for secure communication. The **Red Hat Service Interconnect (RHSI)** ensures that data exchanged between these two environments remains secure, creating a **Virtual Application Network (VAN)** between the sites.

**Site A** hosts the AI model using InstructLab and is responsible for:
- Receiving user input exclusively from Site B (OpenShift).
- Sending the input to the LLaMA3 model for processing.
- Returning the model's response to Site B securely.

**Site B** (OpenShift) serves as the only access point for external clients and is responsible for:
- Exposing the AI chatbot to external users.
- Sending requests to the private InstructLab model in Site A.
- Displaying the AI response from the model hosted in Site A.

By design, the model running in the private environment (Site A) is isolated and cannot be accessed directly by external clients. All interactions with the model are mediated by **OpenShift** (Site B), ensuring a secure and controlled access path.
