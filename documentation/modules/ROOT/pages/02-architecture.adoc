= Architecture  

This architecture outlines a solution for securely deploying a local AI chatbot using **InstructLab** and **Skupper**, while ensuring data privacy and seamless communication between isolated environments. The model is hosted in a private environment, and the service is exposed through a public OpenShift deployment, allowing external access while safeguarding the underlying data and models.

The core elements include:
- **InstructLab** for hosting, training, and serving the AI model in a secure environment.
- **Red Hat Service Interconnect (RHSI)** combined with **Skupper** to create a **Virtual Application Network (VAN)** between private and public sites, enabling secure communication.
- **OpenShift** for exposing the chatbot to external users while maintaining scalability and secure connectivity to the model.

== Common Challenges  

1. **Secure Model Hosting**: Protecting sensitive AI models while allowing controlled external access.  
2. **Hybrid Connectivity**: Facilitating communication between private and public environments without compromising security.  
3. **Data Privacy**: Ensuring that private data remains in a protected environment while providing real-time AI responses to external users.

[#in_depth]  
== An in-depth look at the solution's architecture  

This architecture is based on a hybrid setup where the AI model is trained and served via **InstructLab** in a private environment (Site A) while being exposed to external users through a public **OpenShift** site (Site B) using **Skupper** for secure communication. The **Red Hat Service Interconnect (RHSI)** ensures that data exchanged between these two environments remains secure, creating a **Virtual Application Network (VAN)** between the sites.

**Site A** hosts the AI model using InstructLab, which is responsible for:
- Receiving user input from Site B (OpenShift).
- Sending the input to the LLaMA3 model for processing.
- Returning the model's response to Site B securely.

**Site B** (OpenShift) is responsible for:
- Exposing the AI chatbot to external users.
- Sending requests to the private InstructLab model in Site A.
- Displaying the AI response from the model hosted in Site A.
